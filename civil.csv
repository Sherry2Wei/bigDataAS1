0,Regulator,Final,"SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22533, NOVEMBER 16, 2012: IN COORDINATION WITH THE FEDERAL-STATE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES WORKING GROUP, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHARGED J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES WITH MISLEADING INVESTORS IN OFFERINGS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS). THE FIRM AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN WHICH IT WILL PAY $296.9 MILLION. THE SEC PLANS TO DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY TO HARMED INVESTORS. THE SEC ALLEGED THAT JP MORGAN MISSTATED INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELINQUENCY STATUS OF MORTGAGE LOANS THAT PROVIDED COLLATERAL FOR AN RMBS OFFERING IN WHICH IT WAS THE UNDERWRITER. JP MORGAN RECEIVED FEES OF MORE THAN $2.7 MILLION, AND INVESTORS SUSTAINED LOSSES OF AT LEAST $37 MILLION ON UNDISCLOSED DELINQUENT LOANS. JP MORGAN ALSO IS CHARGED FOR AN ACQUIRED FIRM'S FAILURE TO DISCLOSE ITS PRACTICE OF OBTAINING AND KEEPING CASH SETTLEMENTS FROM MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATORS ON PROBLEM LOANS THAT THE FIRM HAD SOLD INTO RMBS TRUSTS. THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS BULK SETTLEMENT PRACTICE WERE AT LEAST $137.8 MILLION. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT AGAINST JP MORGAN FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN WASHINGTON D.C., FEDERAL REGULATIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF DELINQUENCY INFORMATION RELATED TO ASSETS THAT PROVIDE COLLATERAL FOR AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES OFFERING. INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELINQUENCY STATUS OF MORTGAGE LOANS IN AN RMBS TRANSACTION IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THOSE LOANS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS BY WHICH INVESTORS CAN EARN INTEREST AND OBTAIN REPAYMENT OF THEIR PRINCIPAL. THE SEC ALLEGED THAT IN THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT FOR THE $1.8 BILLION RMBS OFFERING THAT OCCURRED IN DECEMBER 2006, JP MORGAN MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE LOANS THAT PROVIDED COLLATERAL FOR THE TRANSACTION. THE FIRM REPRESENTED THAT ONLY FOUR LOANS (.04 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LOANS COLLATERALIZING THE TRANSACTION) WERE DELINQUENT BY 30 TO 59 DAYS, AND THAT THOSE FOUR WERE THE ONLY LOANS THAT 717 THE SEC ALLEGED THAT IN THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT FOR THE $1.8 BILLION RMBS OFFERING THAT OCCURRED IN DECEMBER 2006, JP MORGAN MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE LOANS THAT PROVIDED COLLATERAL FOR THE TRANSACTION. THE FIRM REPRESENTED THAT ONLY FOUR LOANS (.04 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LOANS COLLATERALIZING THE TRANSACTION) WERE DELINQUENT BY 30 TO 59 DAYS, AND THAT THOSE FOUR WERE THE ONLY LOANS THAT HAD HAD AN INSTANCE OF DELINQUENCY OF 30 OR MORE DAYS IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ""CUT-OFF DATE"" FOR THE TRANSACTION. HOWEVER, AT THE TIME JP MORGAN MADE THESE REPRESENTATIONS, JP MORGAN ACTUALLY HAD INFORMATION SHOWING THAT MORE THAN 620 LOANS (ABOVE 7 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LOANS COLLATERALIZING THE TRANSACTION) WERE, AND HAD BEEN, 30 TO 59 DAYS DELINQUENT, AND THE FOUR LOANS REPRESENTED AS BEING 30 TO 59 DAYS DELINQUENT WERE IN FACT 60 TO 89 DAYS DELINQUENT. User Guidance THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALSO ALLEGED THAT THE ACQUIRED FIRM'S BULK SETTLEMENTS COVERED LOANS COLLATERALIZING 156 DIFFERENT RMBS TRANSACTIONS ISSUED FROM 2005 TO 2007. LOAN ORIGINATORS WERE USUALLY REQUIRED BY CONTRACT TO BUY BACK LOANS THAT SUFFERED EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULTS OR HAD OTHER DEFECTS. HOWEVER, THE FIRM FREQUENTLY NEGOTIATED DISCOUNTED CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THESE LOAN ORIGINATORS IN LIEU OF A BUY-BACK ON LOANS THAT WERE OWNED BY THE RMBS TRUSTS. THE FIRM - BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE MERGER WITH JP MORGAN - THEN KEPT MOST OF THE BULK SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS. THE FIRM FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE PRACTICE TO INVESTORS WHO OWNED THE LOANS. THE FIRM REPURCHASED ONLY ABOUT 13 PERCENT OF THESE DEFECTIVE BULK SETTLEMENT LOANS FROM THE TRUSTS, COMPARED TO A NEARLY 100 PERCENT REPURCHASE RATE WHEN LOAN ORIGINATORS AGREED TO BUY BACK THE DEFECTIVE LOANS. FOR MOST LOANS COVERED BY BULK SETTLEMENTS, THE FIRM COLLECTED MONEY FROM ORIGINATORS WITHOUT PAYING ANYTHING TO THE TRUSTS. JP MORGAN AND ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES SETTLED THE SEC'S CHARGES BY CONSENTING TO PAY DISGORGEMENT OF $39,900,000, PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $10,600,000, AND A PENALTY OF $24,000,000 FOR THE DELINQUENCY MISSTATEMENTS, WHICH THE SEC WILL SEEK TO DISTRIBUTE TO HARMED INVESTORS IN THE TRANSACTION THROUGH A FAIR FUND.

MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (""JPMS"") WITH FRAUDULENTLY RIGGING AT LEAST 93 MUNICIPAL BOND REINVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS IN 31 STATES, GENERATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ILL-GOTTEN GAINS. THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT JPMS VIOLATED SECTION 15(C)(1)(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (""EXCHANGE ACT""). TYPICALLY, WHEN INVESTORS PURCHASE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, THE MUNICIPALITIES TEMPORARILY INVEST THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALES IN MUNICIPAL REINVESTMENT PRODUCTS UNTIL THE MONEY IS USED FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSES. UNDER RELEVANT INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS"") REGULATIONS, THE PROCEEDS OF TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL SECURITIES GENERALLY MUST BE INVESTED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE MOST COMMON WAY OF ESTABLISHING FAIR MARKET VALUE IS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS IN WHICH BIDDING AGENTS SEARCH FOR THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT VEHICLE FOR A MUNICIPALITY. THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT FROM 1997 THROUGH 2005, JPMS'S FRAUDULENT PRACTICES, MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS UNDERMINED THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS, AFFECTED THE PRICES THAT MUNICIPALITIES PAID FOR REINVESTMENT PRODUCTS, AND DEPRIVED CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES OF A CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION THAT THE REINVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS HAD BEEN PURCHASED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. JPMS'S FRAUDULENT CONDUCT ALSO JEOPARDIZED THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BECAUSE THE SUPPOSED COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS THAT ESTABLISHES THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT WAS CORRUPTED. THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT ARE NO LONGER WITH THE COMPANY. THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT JPMS, ACTING AS THE AGENT FOR ITS AFFILIATED COMMERCIAL BANK, AT TIMES WON BIDS BECAUSE IT OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM THE BIDDING AGENTS ABOUT COMPETING BIDS, A PRACTICE KNOWN AS ""LAST LOOKS."" IN OTHER INSTANCES, IT WON BIDS SET UP IN ADVANCE FOR JPMS TO WIN (SET-UPS) BECAUSE THE BIDDING AGENT DELIBERATELY OBTAINED NON-WINNING BIDS FROM OTHER PROVIDERS, AND IT FACILITATED BIDS RIGGED FOR OTHERS TO WIN BY DELIBERATELY SUBMITTING NON-WINNING BIDS. 723 AFFILIATED COMMERCIAL BANK, AT TIMES WON BIDS BECAUSE IT OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM THE BIDDING AGENTS ABOUT COMPETING BIDS, A PRACTICE KNOWN AS ""LAST LOOKS.""

BEAR STEARNS PUBLISHED EXAGGERATED OR UNWARRANTED RESEARCH OR RESEARCH THAT LACKED A REASONABLE BASIS, MADE A PAYMENT TO ANOTHER FIRM FOR THAT FIRM TO PUBLISH RESEARCH ON A BEAR STEARNS' UNDERWRITING CLIENT WITHOUT ENSURING THAT SUCH PAYMENT WAS DISCLOSED, AND FAILED TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION OVER ITS RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATIONS.

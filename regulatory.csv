THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THESE PROCEEDINGS ARISE OUT OF MSSB'S FAILURE TO ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MSSB PERSONNEL FROM MISUSING AND MISAPPROPRIATING FUNDS IN CLIENT ACCOUNTS.

THE HEARING OFFICER ACCEPTS THE OFFER OF SETTLEMENT AND CONSENT AND ISSUES THIS DECISION. User Guidance WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, THE FIRM CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT IT FAILED TO ESTABLISH, DOCUMENT, AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF FOLLOW-UP AND REVIEW, REASONABLY DESIGNED TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL, REGULATORY, AND OTHER RISKS OF ITS MARKET ACCESS BUSINESS. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT SPECIFICALLY, THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH, DOCUMENT, AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS BY REJECTING ORDERS THAT EXCEED APPROPRIATE PRICE OR SIZE PARAMETERS, OR THAT INDICATE DUPLICATIVE ORDERS. DESPITE THE VARIOUS PRE-TRADE CONTROLS AND FILTERS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS THAT THE FIRM HAD IN PLACE DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO IMPLEMENT REASONABLY DESIGNED PRE-TRADE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS APPLICABLE TO ORDERS SUBMITTED BY CERTAIN MARKET ACCESS CLIENTS AND CERTAIN FIRM TRADERS, AND FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS ORDERS DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD. BECAUSE THE FIRM'S PRE-TRADE CONTROLS WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED AS APPLIED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S MARKET ACCESS CLIENTS AND TRADERS, THE FIRM DID NOT PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN ERRONEOUS EQUITY ORDERS TO THE SROS AND TO THE EXCHANGE, CAUSING 14 ERRONEOUS ORDER EVENTS RESULTING IN CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTION (""CEE"") FILINGS WITH THE SELFREGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS (SROS) AND THE EXCHANGE, THREE VOLATILITY TRADING PAUSES (""VTPS"") AND ONE REQUEST FOR A VOLUNTARY BUST (INVOLVING 77 TRADES). THESE ORDERS CAUSED PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE RELATED SECURITIES OF BETWEEN 10 PERCENT AND 188 PERCENT. THERE WERE SEVERAL PRIMARY DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S PRETRADE PRICE AND SIZE CONTROLS THAT RESULTED IN THE SUBMISSION OF THE ORDERS THAT CAUSED THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CEE FILINGS. FURTHER, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECURITY, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADE VOLUME (ADTV) OF A SECURITY. IN ADDITION, A CONTROL APPLICABLE TO LIMIT ORDERS FOR AT LEAST ONE MARKET ACCESS CLIENT, CALLED THE ""OUT OF RANGE/PRICE CHECK"" CONTROL, HAD A GENERALLY APPLICABLE PRICE CHECK THAT MORGAN SECURITIES LLC PERCENTAGE AWAY FROM THE LAST SALE OR WASJ.P. SET AT A PARTICULAR THE PREVIOUS DAY'S CLOSE OR THE AVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL BEST 141 THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECURITY, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADE VOLUME (ADTV) OF A SECURITY. IN ADDITION, A CONTROL APPLICABLE TO LIMIT ORDERS FOR AT LEAST ONE MARKET ACCESS CLIENT, CALLED THE ""OUT OF RANGE/PRICE CHECK"" CONTROL, HAD A GENERALLY APPLICABLE PRICE CHECK THAT WAS SET AT A PARTICULAR PERCENTAGE AWAY FROM THE LAST SALE OR THE PREVIOUS DAY'S CLOSE OR THE AVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL BEST BID OR OFFER (""NBBO""), WHICH WAS TOO HIGH TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS ENTERED DURING PRE-MARKET TRADING HOURS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL REASONABLE CONTROLS. IN AT LEAST TWO INSTANCES, THE FIRM'S CONTROLS WERE NOT APPLIED BECAUSE, AS DESIGNED, THE CONTROLS DID NOT APPLY TO ORDERS THAT HAD BEEN AMENDED OR MODIFIED. User Guidance THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO HAVE REASONABLY DESIGNED RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS TO DETECT INSTANCES WHEN ALGORITHMS USED BY ITS MARKET ACCESS CLIENTS EXPERIENCED CANCEL-REPLACE AND BUY-SELL LOOPING OF ORDERS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, WHICH CAUSED HIGH LEVELS OF MESSAGE TRAFFIC ON THE SROS. PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 2013, JPMS FAILED TO HAVE MESSAGE RATE CONTROLS THAT PERTAINED TO ITS MARKET ACCESS CLIENTS TO DETECT AND PREVENT INADVERTENT ORDERS RESULTING FROM MALFUNCTIONING SOFTWARE PROGRAMS OR SYSTEMS.

Regulator Statement (CONT. FROM THE ALLEGATIONS SECTION)- FURTHER, THE FIRM'S DUPLICATE ORDER CONTROL DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD ONLY REJECTED ORDERS THAT WERE SUBMITTED UNDER IDENTICAL ORDER IDENTIFICATIONS DURING A MARKET ACCESS CLIENT'S TRADING SESSION. MOREOVER, PRIOR TO JANUARY 2014, THE FIRM EMPLOYED SOFT-BLOCK ALERTS FOR ORDER OR MESSAGE ACTIVITY, RATHER THAN ANY HARDBLOCKS, THAT COULD BE OVERRIDDEN, AND THE LEVELS SET FOR THE ALERTS WERE TOO HIGH TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY UNINTENDED MESSAGING ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, THE HARD-BLOCKS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FIRM WERE ALSO SET AT LEVELS THAT WERE TOO HIGH AND REQUIRED ACTIVITY TO PERSIST FOR TOO LONG IN ORDER TO POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY AND PREVENT THE ENTRY OF A HIGH VOLUME OF UNINTENDED ORDERS OR MESSAGES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM'S METHOD FOR DETERMINING APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS FOR MESSAGING ALERTS AND HARDBLOCKS WAS NOT REASONABLE AS IT WAS SOLELY BASED ON A MULTIPLE OF A MARKET ACCESS CLIENT'S PEAK MESSAGING ACTIVITY AND DID NOT ALSO FACTOR IN OTHER INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A CLIENT'S ORDER FLOW. LASTLY, WHILE THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF ALERTS FOR A HIGH VOLUME OF ORDERS OR MESSAGES ON A POST-TRADE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACTIVITY COULD BE INDICATIVE OF A MANIPULATIVE TRADING STRATEGY, THE SURVEILLANCES USED FOR THIS PURPOSE WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO BE EFFECTIVE, AS CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE PARAMETERS WERE SET TOO HIGH AND REQUIRE THE ACTIVITY TO PERSIST TOO LONG, TO GENERATE AN ALERT GIVEN ALL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. 143 MANIPULATIVE TRADING STRATEGY, THE SURVEILLANCES USED FOR THIS PURPOSE WERE NOT REASONABLY DESIGNED TO BE EFFECTIVE, AS CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE PARAMETERS WERE SET TOO HIGH AND REQUIRE THE ACTIVITY TO PERSIST TOO LONG, TO GENERATE AN ALERT GIVEN ALL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. User Guidance THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH, DOCUMENT, AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ORDERS THAT EXCEEDED APPROPRIATE PRE-SET CREDIT THRESHOLDS IN THE AGGREGATE WITH REGARD TO ONE OF ITS MARKET ACCESS CLIENTS. FINRA FOUND THAT DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD, THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH, DOCUMENT, AND MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SUPERVISING CUSTOMER TRADING TO DETECT AND PREVENT POTENTIALLY VIOLATIVE AND MANIPULATIVE ACTIVITY.
